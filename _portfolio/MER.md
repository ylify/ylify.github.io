title: "The complete symbiont genome from a methane-seep thyasirid and the cooperated evolution in anoxic sediment (5th publication, *Molecular Ecology Resources*)"
excerpt: "We report the first circular thyasirid symbiont genome, named Candidatus Ruthturnera sp. Tsphm01, with a size of 1.53â€‰Mb, 1521 coding genes and 100% completeness. Compared to its free-living relatives, Ca. Ruthturnera sp. Tsphm01 genome is reduced, lacking components for chemotaxis, citric acid cycle and de novo biosynthesis of small molecules (e.g. amino acids and cofactors), indicating it is likely an obligate intracellular symbiont. Nevertheless, the symbiont retains complete genomic components of sulphur oxidation and assimilation of inorganic carbon, and these systems were highly and actively expressed. Moreover, the symbiont appears well-adapted to anoxic environment, including capable of anaerobic respiration (i.e. reductions of DMSO and nitrate) and possession of a low oxygen-adapted type of cytochrome c oxidase. Analysis of the host transcriptome revealed its metabolic complementarity to the incomplete metabolic pathways of the symbiont and the acquisition of nutrients from the symbiont via phagocytosis and exosome. <br/><img src='/images/MER_summary.jpg'>"
