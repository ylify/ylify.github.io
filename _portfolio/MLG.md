title: "The chromosomal evolution in Mollusca (6th publications in *eLife*)"
excerpt: "We use synteny to study the karyotype diversity in Mollusca with four chromosome-level chiton genomes. With the constructed Mollusca Linkage Groups, we found that: 1) rearrangements in morphologically conservative Polyplacophora; 2) conserved syntenic matches in Venerida; 3) two different levels duplication events in Gastropoda (real sense of Whole Genome Duplication in Heterobranchia and approximate WGD in Ceanogastropoda); 4) ancient chromosome duplication or fission happend in Polyplacophora (*Liolophura japonica*) and two scaphopods; 5) still confusing events in Cephalopoda. <br/><img src='/images/eLife_summary.jpg'>"
